# popular_disney

This is a README file for the Popular Disney App. It provides information on the architecture, how to install the project, and the current state of the UI, error handling, accessibility, and localization.

## Architecture

The project uses the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern with Tuist as the project generation tool. MVVM helps separate the user interface logic from the business logic and makes it easier to maintain the codebase. Tuist simplifies project generation, making it easier to manage dependencies, generate the project, and integrate with continuous integration and deployment.

Information on how to install Tuist can be found here:
https://docs.tuist.io/tutorial/get-started

## How to install the project

To install the project, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open Terminal and navigate to the project directory.
- Run the following commands in the Terminal:

```
tuist fetch
tuist generate
```
This will fetch the dependencies and generate the project.

### NOTE
### To build or run this project, Tuist installation is necessary.


### UI

The user interface of the project is very basic and is only there to fulfill the project requirements. There is room for improvement in terms of design and usability.

### Error Handling

The project currently does not handle errors or retries. Adding error handling would improve the user experience and make the app more robust.

### Accessibility

The project currently does not support accessibility. Adding accessibility features would make the app more inclusive and usable for a wider range of users.

### Localization

The project currently does not support localization. Adding localization would make the app accessible to users in different regions and languages.

### Conclusion

This README provides an overview of the popular disney project. It covers the architecture, how to install the project, and the current state of the UI, error handling, accessibility, and localization. There is room for improvement in these areas.
